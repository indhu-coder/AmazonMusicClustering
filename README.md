Problem Statement:

  With millions of songs available on platforms like Amazon, manually categorizing tracks into genres is impractical. 
  The goal of this project is to automatically group similar songs based on their audio characteristics using clustering techniques. 
  By analyzing patterns in features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more, learners will develop a model that organizes songs into meaningful clusters, potentially representing different musical genres or moods—without any prior labels.
